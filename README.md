# pythonQuadratics
This program was created originally as a test of how much I knew about quadratic functions and 
to see if I would be able tio make a program in python that analyzes them. 

It isn't completely finished as it doesn't account for imaginary numbers or anything like that but I plan 
to recreate it once I get a better understanding of cmath
